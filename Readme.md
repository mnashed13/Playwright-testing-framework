# Running and Using Playwright with Cucumber Base Repo

[![Echo API Tests](https://github.com/mnashed13/Playwright-testing-framework/actions/workflows/api-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mnashed13/Playwright-testing-framework/actions/workflows/api-tests.yml)

This guide explains how to run and use Playwright with Cucumber for automated testing of web applications.

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js installed on your system
- A project set up with Playwright and Cucumber

**Step 1: Install Playwright and Cucumber**

To install Playwright and Cucumber, run the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install playwright
npm install @cucumber/cucumber
```

**Step 2: Set up Playwright**

Create a new file `playwright.config.js` with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	// Your Playwright configuration
};
```

**Step 3: Write Cucumber Tests**

Create a new file `features/login.feature` with the following content:

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I login with valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in successfully

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I login with invalid credentials
    Then I should see an error message
```

**Step 4: Implement Step Definitions**

Create a new file `steps/login.steps.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/login.page';
import { World } from '../support/world';

Given('I am on the login page', async function (this: World) {
	const loginPage = new LoginPage(this.page);
	await loginPage.navigate('/login');
});

When('I login with valid credentials', async function (this: World) {
	const loginPage = new LoginPage(this.page);
	await loginPage.login(process.env.USERNAME!, process.env.PASSWORD!);
});

Then('I should be logged in successfully', async function (this: World) {
	await expect(this.page.getByText('Welcome')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Step 5: Run the Tests**

To run the tests, execute the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npx cucumber-js
```

- `npm run test:api:smoke` - Run API smoke tests
- `npm run test:echo` - Run Echo API tests specifically

### VS Code Debugging

The project includes several VS Code launch configurations for running tests:

1. **Run All Cucumber Tests**

   - Runs all UI tests in the `src/features` directory using Cucumber
   - Access via VS Code Debug panel (F5)

2. **Run All API Tests**

   - Runs all API tests in the `api-tests/features` directory using Cucumber
   - Access via VS Code Debug panel (F5)

3. **Run Specific Feature File**

   - Run a specific feature file by opening it and using this debug configuration
   - Works for both UI and API tests
   - Access via VS Code Debug panel (F5)

4. **Run Tests with Tags**

   - Run tests filtered by Cucumber tags (e.g., @smoke, @regression)
   - Prompts for tag input when launched
